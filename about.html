<h3>About</h3>
<br> 
    
<p>I can tell you the moment that it really started for me. It was nine years ago, when I was a single mom. I remember watching my one year old son sleeping peacefully. I wanted to be a good example for him, provide stability, someone that he can really be proud of. I wanted to do something extraordinary in my life and create a positive impact. This served as the perfect drive and motivation.</p>   
       
<p>Flash forward to the end of 2014 coming into 2015 a lot of changes started to happen. I graduated from the OATC and earned my Web Development Degree. This is where I was able to pin-point my career and find my passion. I was also given recognition and an award from two of my professors for being a successful student. There is a plaque hanging on the Business Technical Wall with my photo and story on it.</p>

<h4>Family Life</h4>

<p>Most of my time and focus is spent on my Family. I have a beautiful family that includes two children, a husband and a dog. Caidon is 10, Emma is 3 and Sophie thinks she is the boss. My husband Mike also works at Weber State University, in the Stewart Library. He is about to graduate with his Bachelors in Social Work. Very proud of all of them!</p>

<h4>Interests &amp; Hobbies</h4>
    
<p>I have many interests and hobbies. I love exploring, hiking, and simply just being in nature. I do enjoy traveling and have had a chance to live out of country. History and learning of different cultures are fascinating to learn and experience. I also enjoy photography, art, science, technology, philosophy and learning about online entrepreneurships.</p>
    
<p>Being able to work at Weber State University has been a wonderful experience for me. I am currently working on completing my Bachelors in Computer Science/Web Development and plan on continuing to strengthen those skills.</p>
